description: Trigger Lambdas from pub/sub topics, and send messages, SMSs and push notifications to topics and mobile apps, with AWS SNS on Sigma IDE
---

# ![](images/sns/sns_icon.svg) AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a flexible, fully managed pub-sub messaging and mobile notifications service
for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients. With SNS you can fan-out messages to a
large number of subscribers, including distributed systems and services, and mobile devices.

The Sigma IDE currently supports the following 3 types of SNS resources.
- SNS Topics (as triggers as well as for operations)
- Direct SMS via SNS (for operations)
- SNS Platform Applications  (for operations)

## SNS as a Trigger

A SNS topic can be used as a trigger for a lambda function within Sigma. For that, a SNS resource should be dragged from
the resources panel and dropped on top of the `event` parameter of the lambda handler. Then the SNS topic configuration
panel can be used to [set a SNS topic](#set-topic) as the trigger.

When a SNS topic is configured as a trigger to a Lambda function, that function is invoked each time a message is
published to the topic. The structure of trigger event received by Lambda function is of the following format.

      }
   ]

### Trigger Parameters

*SNS triggers do not have any trigger specific parameters.*

### <a name="set-topic">Setting the SNS topic

In SNS topic configuration panel, it is possible either to select an existing SNS topic or to define a new SNS topic.

#### Selecting an existing topic

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="./images/sns/existing_topic.png">
</p>

To select an existing topic, first go to the **Existing Topic** tab of the configuration panel. Then the **Topic Name**
drop-down will be populated with all the already defined SNS topics in your AWS account for the current project region.
You can simply select the required topic from that list.

#### Defining a new topic

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="./images/sns/new_topic.png">
</p>

To define a new topic, first go to the **New Topic** tab of the configuration panel. Then a **Topic Name** should be
provided, and this topic name must be non-empty and should contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), or
underscores (\_). Then a **Display Name** also should be provided and it should less than 10 characters in length.

### <a name="add-topic-subscriptions">Adding subscriptions to a topic

Sigma also provides the facility to add new subscriptions to an existing or a newly defined topic. For that, first click
on the **Subscriptions** button below the topic configuration fields, which will open the subscriptions panel of the topic.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="./images/sns/subscriptions.png">
</p>

If you are using an existing topic which already has any subscriptions, they will be shown under **Existing Subscriptions**,
and they cannot be changed. The new subscriptions you have defined through Sigma will be shown under **New Subscriptions**
and any one of them can be removed by clicking on the remove button in-front.

To add a new subscription, first a subscription protocol should be selected from the drop-down on the left and then a
suitable subscription endpoint should be specified in the right text box. Currently the following types of subscription
protocols are supported.
- HTTP
- HTTPS
- Email
- Email JSON
- SQS
- Application (Platform Application)
- Lambda
- SMS

Subscription Protocol | Endpoint Type | Example
---                   | ---           | ---
HTTP                  | An HTTP URL | `http://slappforge.com`
HTTPS                 | An HTTPS URL | `https://slappforge.com`
Email                 | A valid email address | `info@slappforge.com`
Email JSON            | A valid email address | `info@slappforge.com`
SQS                   | ARN of a SQS queue | `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111111111111:my-queue`
Application (Platform Application) | ARN of a SNS Platform Application | `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:app/GCM/my-app`
Lambda                | ARN of a Lambda function | `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:my-function`
SMS                   | A valid phone number | `+94123123123`

Once the subscription protocol and endpoint are defined, click the + button to add the subscription.

## SNS for Operations

Although only the SNS topic resources can be used as triggers, all 3 types of SNS resources can be used inside Lambda
code as operations. For that, a SNS resource should be dragged from the resources panel and dropped on the required line
of the lambda code editor. Then the required **Resource Type** should be selected from the SNS resource configuration panel.

### SNS Topic resource

When **Topic** is selected as the resource type, first an existing topic should be selected or a new topic should be
defined for the operations. This procedure is exactly similar to [setting a SNS topic](#set-topic) when a SNS trigger is
defined. Once the topic is configured, an operation to be injected can be selected from the **Operation** drop-down.
Currently Sigma supports the following operations on SNS topics.

- Publish Message
- Get Topic Attributes
